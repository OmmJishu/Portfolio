                <h3>ToDoList Application</h3>
                <p style="color: black;">Developed a user authentication Console based ToDo List software in C++ for task management to enhance productivity.</p>
                <p style="color: green;"><strong>Tools & Technologies Used:</strong> C++, STL, Visual Studio, Database: File System, Data Structures: vector, unorderedset, Lambda Expressions</p>
                <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 10%;">
                    <li><strong>Task Management</strong>: The ToDo List Application provides a convenient way to manage tasks by allowing users to add, remove, modify, and view tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Authentication</strong>: Users are required to log in with a unique ID and password. New users can register by creating their ID and password, which are then stored securely for future logins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Task Attributes</strong>: Each task in the ToDo list has three main attributes: Description, Due Date, and Priority.</li>
                    <li><strong>Persistent Storage</strong>: User-specific task lists are stored in text files named after the user's ID and password combination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functionality</strong>: The application includes features like adding, removing, modifying, and viewing tasks, as well as saving changes and exiting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: The application includes error handling mechanisms to handle scenarios such as incorrect user IDs or passwords, invalid task descriptions, and file access errors.</li>
                    <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong>: The application provides a user-friendly interface with clear prompts and instructions for each action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security</strong>: User authentication and task data storage are implemented with security in mind to protect user privacy and prevent unauthorized access to task lists.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customization</strong>: Users can customize their task lists by adding tasks according to their needs and preferences.</li>

                <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h3>
                <p style="color: black;">Implemented a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game application in C++, providing an interactive platform for two players to compete against each other.</p>
                <p style="color: green;"><strong>Tools & Technologies Used:</strong> C++, STL, Visual Studio</p>
                <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 10%;">
                    <li><strong>Classic Game</strong>: Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid to achieve a winning pattern.</li>
                    <li><strong>Console-Based Interface</strong>: The game features a simple console-based interface that allows players to interact using keyboard inputs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Player Versus Player</strong>: The main gameplay mode enables two human players to compete against each other, taking turns to make moves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Winning Conditions</strong>: The game checks for winning conditions after each move to determine if a player has achieved a winning pattern, such as three in a row, column, or diagonal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Draw Detection</strong>: In case all spaces are filled without a winner, the game detects a draw and ends the match.</li>
                    <li><strong>User-Friendly Experience</strong>: The game provides clear prompts and instructions for players, making it easy to understand and play.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle invalid inputs and prevent unexpected behavior during gameplay.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: The code is designed to be scalable, allowing for potential future enhancements such as AI opponents or additional gameplay modes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Educational Purpose</strong>: The project serves as an educational tool for learning basic game development concepts and practicing C++ programming skills.</li>
